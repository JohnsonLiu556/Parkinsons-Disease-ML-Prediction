Predictive Modeling for Parkinson's Disease using Machine Learning

Overview:
- This project aims to develop a predictive model for Parkinson's disease using machine learning techniques. Various algorithms were implemented to analyze voice measurements and predict the presence of Parkinson's disease.

Features:
- Data Preprocessing: Normalization and feature extraction to improve model accuracy.
- Machine Learning Models: Implementation of Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and other algorithms.
- Model Evaluation: Performance metrics such as accuracy and F1 score, with cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for optimization.

Results:
- Detailed results of the model evaluations, including accuracy and F1 scores, can be found in the notebook (with ~88% accuracy for training data and ~87% accuracy for the test data).

Things to keep in mind:
- Under the prediction systems cell, ensure to delete the status (either 1 or 0) when copying the parameters from the datasset.
